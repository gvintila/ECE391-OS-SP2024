CP 1 Buglog:

Milan:

3/15/2024 - BUG: I was bootlooping after implementing the gdt
            FIX: I did not account for the padding in the gdtr struct correctly
                 so I offset the lgdt call by 2 bytes to skip the padding.

3/17/2024 - BUG: My rtc test to flicker the screen with different text only executed once.
            FIX: I was sending the eoi to the incorrect port in my PIC function. I changed it to 
                 send the eoi signal to the command port instead of the data port.

3/17/2024 - BUG: My rtc test was constantly bootlooping.
            FIX: I had a few cases of outb mixed up with the order of port and data so I swapped them.

3/17/2024 - BUG: I kep getting errors when compiling saying that there were multiple
                 instances of different functions.
            FIX: I had named me assmebly file the same as the C file I was using it in. I changed 
                 the name of the assembly file and this issue was resolved.

Adriel:

3/15/2024 - BUG - was using * for gdt_desc
            FIX - do not need to since it references the correct values

3/17/2024 - BUG - getting undefined reference for link function
            FIX - had the same name for c file and .S file

3/17/2024 - BUG - ack bit was not changing or interrupts did not happen in the while loop when waiting for ack bit
            FIX - changed ack variable to volatile and I also called the function when interrupts were DISABLED.

3/17/2024 - BUG - not getting correct ASCII codes when comparing them to my map
            FIX - casted the ints the incorrect way and did not offset from '0' and just got the values themselves

CP2:

3/20/2024 - BUG - Symbols would pop up when pressing number keys (0-9) and when caps lock is ON and shift is OFF
            FIX - Did not take into account that when caps lock is on we use the shifted verion of the letters but the numbers stay unshifted.

3/21/2024 - BUG - Would not insert the first character into the buffer
            FIX - I reset my buffer idx to 0 before putting the enter '\n' to the buffer, so I was esentially replacing the keyboard_buf[0] == ENTER which is not one of my print keys.

3/21//2024 - BUG - Would delete an extra character on console but not the keyboard buffer
             FIX - should not print anything to console but add char '\t' to the buffer

3/22/2024 - BUG - Inconsitency when tabbing and backspace, when typing to video mem it looked fine but the buffer would be missing some spaces.
            FIX - Outputted 0 instead of \t to the screen, initialyl I had an if statement that would return if we see a tab, but we just need to write to screen instead

3/22/2024 - BUG  - Scroll works for half the screeen and outputs garbage values in other
            FIX - Forgot taht each character block in memory corresponds to 2 bytes, the first byte is atrrb and second byte is ascii so i needed to multiply by 2 or shift left by 1
            
3/23/2024 - BUG  - When CTRL+L when keyboard buffer is full, it delets the last character inserted.
            FIX - I initially replace the last char in buffer to 0 because if we ctrl+L it adds the L to the buffer, so we need to delete that. But we only
                  do this if buffer is not full.
